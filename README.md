# Libraries

- Angular JS.
- Foundation 6 css.

# Features
- Grunt commands such as less, copy and connect.

# Future imrovement
- ID can be really the email address or an id that is generated by the server.
- Better validation and server validation if the project is intended to use for example mysql data.
